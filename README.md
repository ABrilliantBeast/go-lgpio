My first attempt at creating CGO binding for the lgpio (https://github.com/joan2937/lg.git) library, which seems to be the most comprehensive library available for the Raspberry Pi.  It supports the most features and hardware.  This is a work in progress, so if you see something wrong, make an issue or fix it yourself.
